## Should I bring an umbrella?

Living in GÃ¶teborg, Sweden means that many mornings you ask yourself the question "do I need an umbrella today?". To outsource more small decisions to computers I programmed a microprocessor that respond with activating a led if an umbrella is recommended.

The idea is very simple. The microprocessor reads the weather forecast from forecast.io for the next 10 hours (which is about the time I expect to be away from home). If any of these hours include rain (more than a few mm) then light the led. Unlit led obviously means no rain.

Light Emitting Diode
Resistor
Usb cable for power supply

#### Weather forecast using the Forecast.io API

#### Code on the microprocessor

Spark Core is a microprocessor that connects to Wifi. You upload your code to it over their cloud service.

Get a Spark Core or similar and connect it to wifi.
Copy my code for the Spark Core. The only needed change is the variable for the url.
